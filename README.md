# Week01-Assignment

# -Archery Zen Club-

## Introduction

This project is the result of my very first week learning HTML and CSS. Since I'm just starting out and the task was to recreate the example website using the skills learned this week, my goal was to build a functional and clean version of the site.

## What I Built

I created a landing page for an archery-themed website. It includes a header with a navigation menu, and three full-screen sections with background images. Each section has a short piece of text overlaid on the image and a button that links to other sections of the page.

I used: -**Semantic HTML** (`<header>`,`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`). -**CSS Flexbox** to lay out the navigation bar and footer. -**Background images** to create full screen sections. -**Absolute positioning** to place text over the images. -**Basic hover effects** for interactivity. -**Smooth scrolling** between sections.

## What Was Difficult

Some parts of the layout were challenging, especially the positioning. At first, I tried to overlay the text boxes using relative positioning, but I realised I needed to use `position: absolute` as the task required.

Centering content inside the footer was another small challenge. Initially, I had a section of pseudo social icons (pseudo because I used emoji), but I gave up on it after too many failed attempts to display them the way I wanted.

## Thank you for reading!

This isn't a professional website - and it's not not even what I wanted to be. But it's a learning project, and I'm excited to keep improving in the next few weeks.
